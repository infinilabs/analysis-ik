# Getting Started

1.create a index

```bash
curl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/index
```

2.create a mapping

```bash
curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/index/_mapping -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d'
{
        "properties": {
            "content": {
                "type": "text",
                "analyzer": "ik_max_word",
                "search_analyzer": "ik_smart"
            }
        }

}'
```

3.index some docs

```bash
curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/index/_create/1 -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d'
{"content":"美国留给伊拉克的是个烂摊子吗"}
'
```

```bash

4.query with highlighting

```bash
curl -XPOST http://localhost:9200/index/_search  -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -d'
{
    "query" : { "match" : { "content" : "中国" }},
    "highlight" : {
        "pre_tags" : ["<tag1>", "<tag2>"],
        "post_tags" : ["</tag1>", "</tag2>"],
        "fields" : {
            "content" : {}
        }
    }
}
'
```

# Dictionary Configuration

Config file `IKAnalyzer.cfg.xml` can be located at `{conf}/analysis-ik/config/IKAnalyzer.cfg.xml`
or `{plugins}/elasticsearch-analysis-ik-*/config/IKAnalyzer.cfg.xml`

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE properties SYSTEM "http://java.sun.com/dtd/properties.dtd">
<properties>
	<entry key="ext_dict">custom/mydict.dic;custom/single_word_low_freq.dic</entry>
	<entry key="ext_stopwords">custom/ext_stopword.dic</entry>
	<entry key="remote_ext_dict">location</entry>
	<entry key="remote_ext_stopwords">http://xxx.com/xxx.dic</entry>
</properties>
```

## Hot-reload Dictionary

The current plugin supports hot reloading dictionary for IK Analysis, through the configuration mentioned earlier in the IK configuration file.

```xml
	<entry key="remote_ext_dict">location</entry>
	<entry key="remote_ext_stopwords">location</entry>
```

Among which `location` refers to a URL, such as `http://yoursite.com/getCustomDict`. This request only needs to meet the following two points to complete the segmentation hot update.

1. The HTTP request needs to return two headers, one is `Last-Modified`, and the other is `ETag`. Both of these are of string type, and if either changes, the plugin will fetch new segmentation to update the word library.

2. The content format returned by the HTTP request is one word per line, and the newline character is represented by `\n`.

Meeting the above two requirements can achieve hot word updates without the need to restart the ES instance.

You can place the hot words that need to be automatically updated in a .txt file encoded in UTF-8. Place it under nginx or another simple HTTP server. When the .txt file is modified, the HTTP server will automatically return the corresponding Last-Modified and ETag when the client requests the file. You can also create a separate tool to extract relevant vocabulary from the business system and update this .txt file.

## FAQs
-------

1. Why isn't the custom dictionary taking effect?

Please ensure that the text format of your custom dictionary is UTF8 encoded.

2. What is the difference between ik_max_word and ik_smart?

ik_max_word: Performs the finest-grained segmentation of the text. For example, it will segment "中华人民共和国国歌" into "中华人民共和国,中华人民,中华,华人,人民共和国,人民,人,民,共和国,共和,和,国国,国歌", exhaustively generating various possible combinations, suitable for Term Query.

ik_smart: Performs the coarsest-grained segmentation of the text. For example, it will segment "中华人民共和国国歌" into "中华人民共和国,国歌", suitable for Phrase queries.

Note: ik_smart is not a subset of ik_max_word.
